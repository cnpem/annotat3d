### Feature Extraction Techniques in Annotat3D

For pixel classification in **Annotat3D**, several features are available:

#### FFT Gauss (Fast Fourier Transform Gauss)

The **FFT Gauss** is a feature that applies the **Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)** to compute the Fourier coefficients of an image, enabling efficient convolution with Gaussian kernels.  
- It progressively blurs the image by adjusting the kernel size, resulting in a smoothing effect. As the **radius diameter** of the Gaussian kernel increases, the image becomes more blurred until the pixels appear nearly homogeneous.

#### FFT Gabor

The **FFT Gabor** filter identifies specific frequency content in an image, particularly within localized regions and in specific directions.  
- It applies a Gaussian kernel modulated by a sinusoidal plane wave, which helps detect textures or edges at particular orientations and frequencies in an image.

#### FFT DoG (Fast Fourier Transform Difference of Gaussians)

The **FFT DoG** filter calculates two Gaussian-blurred versions of an image and subtracts one from the other.  
- This technique enhances edges and other high-frequency details by focusing on the difference between different levels of blur in the image.

#### Sobel

The **Sobel filter** is a gradient-based method for edge detection.  
- It approximates the gradient of the image intensity at each pixel, highlighting areas of high contrast which usually correspond to edges in the image.

#### Membrane Projections

The **Membrane Projections** feature enhances membrane-like structures in the image.  
- It applies **directional filtering** to highlight elongated or membrane-like regions within the image.

#### Minimum, Maximum, Variance, Average, Median

These are basic statistical filters applied to the image within a specified window size.
- **Minimum**: Sets the target pixel to the minimum value within the window.
- **Maximum**: Sets the target pixel to the maximum value.
- **Variance**: Computes the variance within the window.
- **Average**: Replaces the pixel with the average of surrounding values.
- **Median**: Replaces the pixel with the median value from the window.

#### LBP (Local Binary Pattern)

The **Local Binary Pattern (LBP)** is a texture operator that captures the local structure of an image.  
- It assigns a binary label to each pixel based on the intensity values of its neighboring pixels, capturing the texture by comparing the pixel to its surroundings.

#### Multi-scale Filtering Windows (MFW)

The **Multi-scale Filtering Windows** parameter specifies the size of the windows used by the filtering methods.  
- It defines the radius of square windows around each pixel that is used to compute operations like minimum, maximum, or median. For example, a sequence of "2, 4, 6" results in windows of sizes 5x5, 9x9, and 13x13 pixels, respectively.

#### Feature Selection

The **Feature Selection** parameter evaluates the importance of each feature in the classification process.  
- It assesses how much the classification accuracy changes when a specific feature is removed. Features that contribute less than the specified threshold are disregarded.

 Parameter:

`Threshold`: This value is expressed as a percentage (e.g., 0.01) and determines the cutoff for feature importance. If the threshold is set too high, an error may occur, indicating it should be lowered.
