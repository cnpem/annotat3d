### Description

The BM3D (Block-Matching and 3D Filtering) algorithm is a state-of-the-art method for image denoising, 
designed to remove noise while preserving fine details and textures in the image. BM3D operates by grouping similar 
image blocks into 3D groups and applying collaborative filtering to enhance denoising performance.

_sigma 200, two step_

### Parameters


 `Sigma`: Noise standard deviation. This parameter controls the amount of noise reduction applied to the image. 
 Higher values remove more noise but may also remove finer details. Typical values range from 10 to 40 depending on the noise level in the image.


 `Two steps`: Determines if the second step is applied. The second step of the algorithm, which refines 
 the results of the hard-thresholding using Wiener filtering. It uses the estimate from the first step
 as a basis for calculating local means and variances to further improve denoising.
