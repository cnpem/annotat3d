### Description

Gaussian filter is linear filter where the kernel weights are a gaussian curve. The main effect is blurring the image, since in a way, its doing a weighted avarage.
The algorithm is applied in its possible to apply 1D kernel in all dimensions and have equivalent results to 2D and 3D kenrel with faster time.

_sigma 1, 2D convolution_

### Parameters

 `Sigma`: It determines localized in the center, higher values are broder gaussian and therefore will blur the image more.

 `Convolution 2D or 3D`: Determines if its applied in 2D or 3D neighborhood.
