### Description

The Non-Local Means (NLM) filter is another advanced technique for image denoising that works by comparing patches of the image instead of 
just individual pixels. This approach allows the filter to preserve fine textures and details while effectively reducing noise.

_Sigma = 0, h = 500, Big window = 21, Small window = 5_

### Parameters

`Sigma`: Controls the sensitivity of the Gaussian weighting based on pixel intensity differences. Lower values lead to sharper results, while higher values increase smoothing.

`h`: A parameter that controls the degree of similarity between pixel patches. Higher values result in greater similarity requirements for considering patches as similar.

`Big Window`: The size of the search neighborhood for comparing pixel patches in the Non-Local Means algorithm. Larger windows consider more distant pixels for comparison.

`Small Window`: Defines the local neighborhood size used for computing the similarity between patches. It affects how much surrounding pixel information is considered in the similarity comparison.
