### Description

It takes the median of the neighborhood. It's usefull for removing salt and pepper noise. Salt and pepper noise is an impulse type of noise in images. 
This noise is generally caused by errors in data transmission, 
failure in memory cell or analog-to-digital converter errors [[1]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0898122115002710).


<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={MedianFilter} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
_kernel size of 3_

### Parameters

 `kernel size`: Specifies the size of the kernel, which defines the area/volume around each pixel/voxel that the filter considers when processing the image. A larger kernel means more neighboring elements are included in the calculation.

 `Convolution 2D or 3D`: Determines if its applied in 2D or 3D neighborhood.
