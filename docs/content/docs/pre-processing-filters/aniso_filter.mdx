### Description

Performs anisotropic diffusion on a 2D or 3D image.

This function applies the anisotropic diffusion algorithm to enhance images by reducing noise while preserving edges. 
The function supports three different diffusion options that control the smoothing behavior.

_kappa 280, Time setep size 0.1, Number of Iterations 60, Hyperbolic tangent decay, 3D neighbourhood_


### Parameters

 `Total iterations`: Number of iterations to perform. For the default option, hyperbolic tangent decay, usually, 20-60 iterations is enough to converge. Others might take more than 100 iterations. With more iterations more time is required.

 `deltaT`: Time step size. Default is 0.1. Higher values might cause unwanted effects and lower values will require more iterations.
 
 `kappa`: Gradient modulus threshold that influences the conduction. Values for noticible changes hyperbolic tangent decay varies between 200-300, and for other options between 50-200.
  
 `2D or 3D`: The diffusion can occur within the slice (2D neighborhood) or within the volume (3D neighborhood). 3D tends to converge faster and preserve more details.

 `diffusionOption`: Choice of diffusion function:
  1. Exponential decay,
  
  2. Inverse quadratic decay,
  
  3. Hyperbolic tangent decay.

  **Note:** Option 3 is a faster implementation based on the following paper:
