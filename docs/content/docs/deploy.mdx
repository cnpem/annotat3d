The deployment of the DeepSirius application is a delicate process for it relies
on a very specific infrastructure and a set of dependencies to work properly.

## Requirements
The application setup itself is quite simple, just set the environment variables
and run some docker containers. However, the infrastructure setup is a bit more 
complex.

This app assumes that you have a HPC cluster with a SLURM scheduler running,
a LDAP server for authentication that its users are also in the HPC cluster, and
some shared storage for the data with API endpoints for the I/O operations.
