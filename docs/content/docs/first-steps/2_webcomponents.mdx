## Loading and Saving

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={TopCorner} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />

On the top left corner, there is an option to load files (after the previous inital screen) and save files.

You can load more components, but its really recommend to load everything at once when creating a new instance.
See inital steps for more details.

For saving files, just specify the name and the type of the data as indicated in the text for each file component.
Since the workspace is already defined (output path asked previously), there is no need to write the full path, it will save into proper output path.

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={LoadComponents} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />


Here is the type of names that can be used in all the save files options:

<Files>
  <File name="this_is_image_raw_file_200x200x100_16float.raw" />
  <File name="this_is_my_super_pixel_file.b" />
  <File name="this_is_my_label_image.tiff" />
  <File name="this_is_my_annotation.pkl" />
  <File name="this_is_my_classifier.model" />
</Files>

## Canvas

The canvas displays the image of the loaded volume, where you can interact using the mouse. Scroll up to zoom in, and scroll down to zoom out. 
You can also hold the middle mouse button to pan the image. If you lose track of the imageâ€™s position, you can easily reset it.

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={Canvas} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />

In the canvas it also contains the annotation tools, that will interact with the image, renderization of label, superpixel and other components.

## Navigation

Visualization and annotation are available on all three orthogonal views. 
The component is located at the top right, where you can switch between views by clicking the corresponding tabs. 
The slider allows you to change slices, with the update applied after releasing the button. For more precise adjustments, 
you can also directly input the slice number.

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={SliceChange} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />

## Crop and merge

For large images, users can crop the original image to focus on a specific Volume of Interest (VOI). Within this VOI, 
all inference and annotation processes are performed more efficiently. Once satisfactory results are achieved, 
pressing the merge button ensures that annotations and labels are preserved while restoring image original size. 
This approach enables users to work more efficiently within the VOI and later apply the results to 
a larger scale with minimal waiting time. By focusing on a smaller region first, the number of interactions is reduced, 
leading to a smoother workflow and improved overall efficiency.

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={CropMerge} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />


## Vizualzation

The histogram of the image is calculated in 8-bit format, using 255 bins regardless of the original data type. 
In the tab, you can adjust the colormap and modify the rendering range, effectively adjusting the contrast view.
The there is a pin in the sliding knob the shows the rounded value of the range while interactiong with it.

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={ColorMap} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />

For annotations, superpixels, and labels, you can change their opacity and toggle visibility. Additionally, superpixels allow for customizable colors.

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={ToolsForViz} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />


In annotation tools, to help in the annotation process it's possible to hide one label (its annotation and label image) by clicking in the eye button, next to
the name and color of the label.
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={VizAnnotLabel} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />

## Annotation tools

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={Annotation} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />

Annotation tools contains everything related to annotation. For now the main component is the label table. For more infomration, go to the annotations section.

## Processing tools

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={Processing} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />

Processing tools will contain the preprocessing tools (called smoothing) along with superpixel and pixel segmentation.

<ImageZoom alt="kernel" src={ProcessingOptions} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
