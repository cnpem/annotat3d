Waterpixels (or superpixel) serve as a crucial preprocessing step, grouping pixels into homogeneous
regions while balancing compactness and boundary adherence, enhancing the time performance of subsequent segmentation algorithms.

### Parameters

`Method`: Waterpixel 2D, applied in area, for each slice, or 3D applied in the volume.

`Seed distance`: Seed distance defines the spacing between the initial seeds in a regular grid. 
The seed pixels initiate the superpixel formation, and their distance from each other 
controls the resolution of the Waterpixels. Smaller values lead to a higher number of seeds, resulting in smaller and more numerous Waterpixels. 
Conversely, larger values result in larger, fewer superpixels.

 `Compactness`: Compactness refers to how uniformly shaped and clustered the resulting Waterpixels are.
In Waterpixel estimation, compactness is controlled by a parameter that adjusts the trade-off between maintaining compact regions versus adhering closely 
to the object boundaries. A lower value allows the watershed algorithm to follow object boundaries more closely, 
whereas a higher value pushes it toward generating more uniformly shaped Waterpixels.
