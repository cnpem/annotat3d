Pixel segmentation and Superpixel Segmentation :

`Feature extraction parameters`: Filters are used to enrich the image information for machine learning-based image segmentation

`Multi-scale Parameters`: Some of these filters are directly related to Multi-scale Filtering Windows (MFW), where every
number of adjacencies is important
to the final calculation

`Classifier parameters`: Select the machine-learning model, currently, Random Forest and SVM are implemented to run in GPU, others run in CPU and therefore are slower.

Superpixel segmentation:

`Superpixel feature pooling`: To classify the superpixel, the pixel information is used. Select options to use the information of the features from the image, mean, maximum and/or minimum.


### Preprocess

Calculates the pixel/superpixel features for the classifier.


### Preview

The preview takes all the annotation available and using the classifier and features predicts the output for the current slice shown in canvas.

### Apply

Inference for the whole volume, using the annotations as tranning.
