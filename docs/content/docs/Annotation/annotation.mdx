Annotation is the crucial part of the process where the user will create a sample that represents the class for each desired label. As of the writing
of this documentation, Annotat3D only has manual annotation tool, however in the near future auxiliary tools for annotation will be implemented.

## Annotation Tools

### Basic Annotation

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Create a new label" id="new-label">
On the annotation sidebar, you can create new labels by clicking the ADD button. Change the color for each new annotation label at will.
By default there is a label (unremovable) called background, and in the inference the vizualization of this labelmap will be hidden.
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={NewLabel} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Change brush size" id="brush-size">
In clicking the "+" or "-" button you add brushsize in steps, by holding it, it will increase faster or decrease faster.
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={BrushSize} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Erase annotations" id="erase-annotation">
In the brushlist, there is the eraser options for erasing specific parts of the label.
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={EraseAnnot} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Undo Annotations at will" id="undo-annotation">
Made a mistake in the annotation? While Erasing? No problem, just hit the red "undo" button under the label table.
Unfurtonely, there is no undo "undo" (i.e redo) yet.
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={UndoAnnot} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hide specific label and annotation" id="label-hide">
To help in the annotation process it's possible to hide one label (its annotation and label image) by clicking in the eye button, next to
the name and color of the label.
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={VizAnnotLabel} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Easily create multiple labels" id="seq-label">
By checkmarking the option of "sequential label", you can create multiple new labels!
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={SequentialLabel} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Delete all labels" id="delete-all">
Click on the red button "Delete all labels" to delete all annotation and inference labels!
This can't be undone, its <span className="text-red-600 dark:text-red-400">IRREVERSIBLE</span>.
<ImageZoom alt="Home page" src={DeleteAll} className="!my-0 rounded-sm" />
</Accordion>

</Accordions>
