Magic wand fills the slice image starting from the initial seed, point given when the user clicks the image, and checks if 
the neighbour pixel is within a threshold range (bigger than the lower limit and lower than the high limit), if it's true
its filled with the annotation label. It propagates until there is no more pixels to fill.

To use it, you need to click on the tool, and then click on a start position in the slice image. After that, in the
histogram, the intensity of the clicked pixel will be marked as a red bar in the histogram and the upper and lower limits
can be adjusted using the sliders or with manual input by typing the value and pressing the enter key.

You can also smooth the output in the smoothing option, which will apply a gaussian blur on the label output of the magic wand.
