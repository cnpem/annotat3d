### Watershed Segmentation  

The **watershed algorithm** is a region-based segmentation method that treats an image like a topographic surface, where intensity values represent elevation. The algorithm simulates water flooding from **seed points** and assigns each pixel to the nearest seed, forming distinct segmented regions.  

In this implementation, the **seeds** are derived from **annotations or labels** provided in the image. These labeled regions serve as the initial markers for the segmentation process.  

#### **Parameters**  
- **Prewitt Filter**: Computes the gradient magnitude using the Prewitt operator, highlighting edges and transitions in the image (first order derivative).  
- **Sobel Filter**: Similar to Prewitt but uses a slightly different kernel, often producing **smoother** gradient transitions (second order derivatives).  

Both filters are used as **input images** to guide the watershed algorithm by detecting edges, ensuring segmentation aligns with meaningful boundaries.
