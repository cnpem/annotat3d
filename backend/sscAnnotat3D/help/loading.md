### Loading Image

The first thing you have to do is load an image into the application. Select the image in `Menu -> File` located in the upper left corner. After selecting the option to load the image, a window to select the file will open. At the bottom of this window you can select the type of image you want to open, you can choose tiff or raw. If the selected image is raw it will open a third window, like the image below,  where you should place the dimensions of the image and the type of the image.
